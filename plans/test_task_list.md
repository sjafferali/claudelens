# Backend Test Coverage Improvement Task List

This document tracks the tasks for systematically improving test coverage in the ClaudeLens backend. Each task represents a single test file to write or improve, followed by a verification task to ensure all tests pass.

## Instructions for Maintaining This Document

1. **Mark tasks as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` after completing each task
2. **Add the completion date** next to completed tasks (e.g., `[x] Task name - 2025-08-05`)
3. **Document any issues or blockers** in the Notes section for each task
4. **Update coverage percentages** after completing each set of tests
5. **Run all backend tests** after each task to ensure no regressions

## Running Tests

To run all backend tests with coverage:
```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

To run tests for a specific file:
```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest tests/test_services_validation.py -v
```

## Notes and Blockers

### General Notes
- Focus on testing happy paths first, then error cases
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies (MongoDB, etc.)
- Ensure each test is independent and can run in isolation

### Discovered Issues
- (Document any issues found while writing tests)

### Dependencies to Mock
- MongoDB connections
- External API calls
- File system operations
- WebSocket connections
