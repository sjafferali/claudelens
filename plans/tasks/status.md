## Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Task 01 (Project Setup) → All other tasks
2. Task 02 (Dev Environment) → All development tasks
3. Task 03 (MongoDB) → Tasks 09, 10, 11
4. Task 08 (Backend API) → Tasks 09, 10, 11
5. Task 13 (Frontend Setup) → All frontend tasks

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Tasks 06-07 (CLI) can be done in parallel with tasks 08-11 (Backend)
- Tasks 13-20 (Frontend) can be done in parallel with backend work
- Task 04 (GitHub Actions) can be done anytime after task 01

## Current Sprint (Phase 1: Foundation)

Focus on these tasks first:
1. [ ] Task 01: Project Setup
2. [ ] Task 02: Development Environment
3. [ ] Task 03: MongoDB Setup
4. [ ] Task 04: GitHub Actions
5. [ ] Task 05: Docker Infrastructure

## Notes and Updates

### Implementation Guidelines
- Always check for existing patterns in the codebase before implementing new features
- Write tests alongside implementation when possible
- Update API documentation after implementing endpoints
- Ensure all code follows the established style guides
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
