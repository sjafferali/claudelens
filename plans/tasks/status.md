# ClaudeLens Task Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of all ClaudeLens tasks. Each task has a detailed specification in the `todo/` directory. Update this document as tasks are completed.

## Task Implementation Guide

### Getting Started
1. Review this status document to find the next TODO task
2. Read the detailed task specification in `plans/tasks/todo/[task-file].md`
3. Change the task status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
4. Implement the task according to specifications
5. Test your implementation thoroughly
6. Update the task status to COMPLETED
7. Add any important notes or deviations in the Notes column

### Status Definitions
- **TODO**: Task not yet started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished and tested
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies

## Progress Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 24
- **Completed**: 0 (0%)
- **In Progress**: 0 (0%)
- **TODO**: 24 (100%)
- **Blocked**: 0 (0%)

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Task 01 (Project Setup) → All other tasks
2. Task 02 (Dev Environment) → All development tasks
3. Task 03 (MongoDB) → Tasks 09, 10, 11
4. Task 08 (Backend API) → Tasks 09, 10, 11
5. Task 13 (Frontend Setup) → All frontend tasks

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Tasks 06-07 (CLI) can be done in parallel with tasks 08-11 (Backend)
- Tasks 13-20 (Frontend) can be done in parallel with backend work
- Task 04 (GitHub Actions) can be done anytime after task 01

## Current Sprint (Phase 1: Foundation)

Focus on these tasks first:
1. [ ] Task 01: Project Setup
2. [ ] Task 02: Development Environment
3. [ ] Task 03: MongoDB Setup
4. [ ] Task 04: GitHub Actions
5. [ ] Task 05: Docker Infrastructure

## Notes and Updates

### Implementation Guidelines
- Always check for existing patterns in the codebase before implementing new features
- Write tests alongside implementation when possible
- Update API documentation after implementing endpoints
- Ensure all code follows the established style guides
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages

### Task Updates Log
<!-- Add entries here as tasks are updated -->
- 2025-01-14 - Tasks 06, 07, 09 - Updated with detailed Claude data structure analysis
