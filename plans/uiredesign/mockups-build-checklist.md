# ClaudeLens UI Mockups - Build Checklist

## Overview
This checklist contains all UI/UX design mockup tasks that can be worked on independently from the main codebase implementation. These tasks involve creating HTML/CSS mockups for future features without modifying the existing application code.

## üîç QA Checkpoint: Mockup Review
*Review all completed mockups for consistency and usability.*

**QA Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify all mockups follow consistent design language
- [ ] Check responsive design for all screen sizes
- [ ] Validate accessibility considerations (color contrast, font sizes)
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are clearly indicated
- [ ] Review documentation for completeness
- [ ] Gather stakeholder feedback on mockups
- [ ] Create implementation priority list based on feedback

## Workflow Process

### For Implementation Agents
1. Find the first unchecked `[ ]` task in any mockup story
2. Create the mockup according to specifications
3. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Continue until completing a full mockup story
5. Save all files in `/plans/uiredesign/mockups/` directory

### File Naming Convention
- Main mockup: `feature-name.html`
- Styles: `feature-name.css`
- JavaScript (if needed): `feature-name.js`
- Documentation: `feature-name-decisions.md`

### Mockup Requirements
- Must be self-contained HTML files
- Include inline CSS or separate CSS file
- Add comments explaining design decisions
- Include both light and dark mode versions
- Make interactive elements functional (JavaScript)
- Add sample data for realistic preview

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure mockup effectiveness:
- Stakeholder approval rate
- Number of design iterations required
- Implementation time saved by having mockups
- User feedback on proposed designs
- Accessibility compliance score

---

## Notes

- Mockups should be created independently without modifying the main application
- Focus on user experience and visual clarity
- Consider accessibility from the start
- Document all design decisions for future reference
- These mockups will guide future implementation work
