## üîÄ Phase 3: Advanced Features

### User Story 10: Clean Up Deprioritized Features
*As a developer, I want to remove code for deprioritized features so the codebase remains clean and maintainable.*

**Tasks:**
- [x] Search for any undo/redo navigation implementation
- [x] Remove any onboarding tour components or dependencies
- [x] Check for and remove video tutorial references in documentation

- [x] Remove references to materialized views in backend
- [x] Update any imports/exports affected by removals
- [x] Verify frontend builds without errors after cleanup
- [x] Verify backend tests pass after cleanup

**Note:** See `/plans/uiredesign/deprioritized-features.md` for detailed reasoning on why these features were removed.

### User Story 11: Fix Sidechain Panel - Show Tool Operations
*As a user, I want to see tool operations in the sidechain panel so I can understand what operations Claude performed.*

**Tasks:**
- [x] Investigate why sidechain panel shows "0 groups" for all conversations
- [x] Check if messages are properly marked with `isSidechain: true` in database
- [x] Verify sidechain filtering logic in `SidechainPanel.tsx`
- [x] Check if tool_use/tool_result messages should be marked as sidechains
- [x] Fix sidechain detection/marking during data import
- [x] Test with conversations containing tool operations
- [x] Verify panel shows tool calls, file operations, searches
- [x] Update sidechain categorization if needed

- ‚úÖ Updated SidechainPanel.tsx to also recognize tool_use/tool_result messages as sidechains
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging to trace sidechain filtering
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue Found**: Tool messages in Claude export data don't have `parentUuid` field set, preventing proper grouping
- **Root Cause**: Claude's export format doesn't include parent-child relationships for tool messages
- **Next Steps**: Would need to infer parentUuid based on message order or timestamps during import

- [ ] Add deep linking support for branches (messageId + branchIndex)
- [ ] Test link sharing across different browsers
- [ ] Document linking format in help text

**Note:** Basic message linking already works via `?messageId=` parameter. This enhances UX.

### User Story 14: Fix Scroll Position Reset on Load More

- [ ] Use subtle gray text to avoid visual clutter
- [ ] Add option to toggle position indicators
- [ ] Include position in URL when sharing links
- [ ] Show position range in viewport (e.g., "Viewing 45-52 of 267")
- [ ] Add position-based navigation ("Jump to message #")
- [ ] Update positions when messages are filtered/hidden

## Workflow Process

### For Implementation Agents
1. Find the first unchecked `[ ]` task that is NOT a QA checkpoint
2. Implement the task according to specifications
3. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Continue until reaching a QA checkpoint or completing a user story
5. Run basic tests to verify your implementation works

### For QA Checkpoints
1. When encountering a QA checkpoint, perform ALL verification tasks
2. Use Playwright MCP to test UI functionality
3. Run all linting, formatting, and test commands
4. If all checks pass: Mark checkpoint as `[x]`
5. If any check fails:
   - Mark checkpoint as `[FAILED - <specific issues>]`
   - Mark failing tasks as `[REWORK - <what needs fixing>]`
   - Document issues clearly for the next agent

### Task Status Markers
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed successfully
- `[REWORK - <issue>]` - Needs to be redone due to QA failure
- `[FAILED - <reason>]` - QA checkpoint failed, see details
- `[BLOCKED - <reason>]` - Cannot proceed due to external dependency

### Continuous Process
Agents should use `/plans/uiredesign/continue-prompt.md` to understand the full context and continue work. The process is:
1. Agent implements tasks ‚Üí 2. QA verification ‚Üí 3. Fix any issues ‚Üí 4. Repeat

## Notes

- Start with Phase 1 for immediate user value
- Each user story can be released independently
- Prioritize based on user feedback
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance impact of visualization features
- QA checkpoints ensure quality before moving to next phase
