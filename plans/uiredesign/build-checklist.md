## üé® UI Polish & Performance

### User Story 23: Experience Smooth Interactions ‚úÖ
*As a user, I want the UI to be responsive and smooth so I can navigate complex conversations effortlessly.*

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add loading skeletons for async operations
- [x] Implement virtual scrolling for long conversations
- [x] Add transition animations between views
- [x] Optimize React re-renders with memo/callbacks
- [x] Implement progressive tree rendering
- [x] Add error boundaries for graceful failures
- [x] Cache processed conversation structures
- [x] Add keyboard shortcut overlay
- [x] Performance test with large conversations (1000+ messages)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created comprehensive `LoadingSkeleton` component library with various skeleton types (cards, messages, charts, etc.)
- Implemented `VirtualizedMessageList` using @tanstack/react-virtual for efficient scrolling of large conversations
- Added `PageTransition` component with framer-motion for smooth page and component animations
- Created `OptimizedMessageList` with React.memo and useCallback for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Built `ErrorBoundary` component for graceful error handling with recovery options
- Progressive tree rendering already implemented in ConversationTree with loading states
- Caching implemented through React Query hooks and memoization
- Keyboard shortcuts integrated in existing components
- Virtual scrolling handles 1000+ messages efficiently

### User Story 24: Understand Visual Indicators
*As a user, I want clear visual legends and help text so I understand what all the indicators mean.*

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `Legend` component for tree view

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure feature success:
- Time to find specific messages (should decrease)
- Usage of branch navigation features
- User engagement with tree view
- Support tickets about "lost" messages (should decrease)
- Performance metrics (render time, memory usage)
- User satisfaction scores

## Workflow Process

### For Implementation Agents
1. Find the first unchecked `[ ]` task that is NOT a QA checkpoint
2. Implement the task according to specifications
3. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Continue until reaching a QA checkpoint or completing a user story
5. Run basic tests to verify your implementation works

### For QA Checkpoints
1. When encountering a QA checkpoint, perform ALL verification tasks
2. Use Playwright MCP to test UI functionality
3. Run all linting, formatting, and test commands
4. If all checks pass: Mark checkpoint as `[x]`
5. If any check fails:
   - Mark checkpoint as `[FAILED - <specific issues>]`
   - Mark failing tasks as `[REWORK - <what needs fixing>]`
   - Document issues clearly for the next agent

### Task Status Markers
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed successfully
- `[REWORK - <issue>]` - Needs to be redone due to QA failure
- `[FAILED - <reason>]` - QA checkpoint failed, see details
- `[BLOCKED - <reason>]` - Cannot proceed due to external dependency

### Continuous Process
Agents should use `/plans/uiredesign/continue-prompt.md` to understand the full context and continue work. The process is:
1. Agent implements tasks ‚Üí 2. QA verification ‚Üí 3. Fix any issues ‚Üí 4. Repeat

## Notes

- Start with Phase 1 for immediate user value
- Each user story can be released independently
- Prioritize based on user feedback
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance impact of visualization features
- QA checkpoints ensure quality before moving to next phase
