## Workflow Process

### For Implementation Agents
1. Find the first unchecked `[ ]` task that is NOT a QA checkpoint
2. Implement the task according to specifications
3. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Continue until reaching a QA checkpoint or completing a user story
5. Run basic tests to verify your implementation works

### For QA Checkpoints
1. When encountering a QA checkpoint, perform ALL verification tasks
2. Use Playwright MCP to test UI functionality
3. Run all linting, formatting, and test commands
4. If all checks pass: Mark checkpoint as `[x]`
5. If any check fails:
   - Mark checkpoint as `[FAILED - <specific issues>]`
   - Mark failing tasks as `[REWORK - <what needs fixing>]`
   - Document issues clearly for the next agent

### Task Status Markers
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed successfully
- `[REWORK - <issue>]` - Needs to be redone due to QA failure
- `[FAILED - <reason>]` - QA checkpoint failed, see details
- `[BLOCKED - <reason>]` - Cannot proceed due to external dependency

### Continuous Process
Agents should use `/plans/uiredesign/continue-prompt.md` to understand the full context and continue work. The process is:
1. Agent implements tasks ‚Üí 2. QA verification ‚Üí 3. Fix any issues ‚Üí 4. Repeat

## Notes

- Start with Phase 1 for immediate user value
- Each user story can be released independently
- Prioritize based on user feedback
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance impact of visualization features
- QA checkpoints ensure quality before moving to next phase
