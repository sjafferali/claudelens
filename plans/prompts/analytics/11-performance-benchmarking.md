# Performance Benchmarking Implementation

## Context
ClaudeLens tracks comprehensive metrics across projects and time periods, enabling comparative performance analysis and benchmarking.

## Feature Description
Implement a performance benchmarking system that compares metrics across projects, teams, and time periods using multi-dimensional analysis.

## Requirements

### Backend Implementation
1. Create endpoints:
   - `GET /api/v1/analytics/benchmarks`
   - `POST /api/v1/analytics/create-benchmark`
   - `GET /api/v1/analytics/benchmark-comparison`

2. Benchmark dimensions:
   ```python
   # Key performance indicators:
   #   - Cost efficiency (cost per outcome)
   #   - Speed (avg response time)
   #   - Quality (error rate)
   #   - Productivity (tasks per session)
   #   - Complexity (avg conversation depth)
   # Normalization methods:
   #   - Z-score normalization
   #   - Min-max scaling
   #   - Percentile ranking
   ```

3. Response schema:
   ```typescript
   {
     benchmarks: [{
       entity: string,  // project/team/period name
       metrics: {
         cost_efficiency: number,
         speed_score: number,
         quality_score: number,
         productivity_score: number,
         complexity_handling: number,
         overall_score: number
       },
       percentile_ranks: {
         cost_efficiency: number,
         speed: number,
         quality: number,
         productivity: number
       },
       strengths: string[],
       improvement_areas: string[]
     }],
     comparison_matrix: {
       headers: string[],
       data: number[][],
       best_performer_per_metric: string[]
     },
     insights: {
       top_performers: string[],
       biggest_improvements: [{
         entity: string,
         metric: string,
         improvement: number
       }],
       recommendations: string[]
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend Implementation
1. Create components:
   - `BenchmarkRadar.tsx` - Radar chart for multi-dimensional comparison
   - `BenchmarkMatrix.tsx` - Comparison matrix table
   - `BenchmarkTrends.tsx` - Performance trends over time
   - `BenchmarkLeaderboard.tsx` - Ranked performance view

2. Visualizations:
   - Radar/spider chart for dimensional comparison
   - Heat map matrix for quick comparison
   - Sparklines for trend indicators
   - Bar chart races for temporal changes

### UI/UX Requirements
- Interactive dimension selection
- Customizable benchmark groups
- Performance badges/achievements
- Export benchmark reports
- Drill-down to detailed metrics

## Technical Considerations
- Fair comparison across different project types
- Handle missing or incomplete data
- Statistical significance testing
- Benchmark version control
- Performance for large comparisons

## Success Criteria
- Meaningful performance comparisons
- Actionable improvement insights
- Fair and transparent scoring
- Motivational leaderboard system
