# Search Highlighting Fix Summary

## Issue
The search highlighting feature was implemented but not working properly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **MongoDB Text Index Configuration**: The text index was only configured for `message.content` and `toolUseResult` fields, but the data structure also has a direct `content` field that wasn't indexed.

2. **Visibility**: The highlighting styles needed to be more prominent for better visibility.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Updated Text Index Creation** (`backend/app/core/db_init.py`):
   - Added `content` field to the text index alongside `message.content` and `toolUseResult`
   - This ensures all content variations are searchable

2. **Enhanced Highlight Styling** (`frontend/src/pages/Search.tsx`):
   - Changed highlight background from `bg-yellow-300` to `bg-yellow-400` for better visibility
   - Added `text-black` to ensure text contrast
   - Changed font weight from `font-semibold` to `font-bold`
   - Increased padding from `px-0.5` to `px-1`

3. **Created Index Update Script** (`backend/scripts/update_text_index.py`):
   - Script to drop and recreate the text index with all necessary fields
   - Run this script to update existing deployments

## How to Apply the Fix

For existing deployments:
1. Run the text index update script:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scripts/update_text_index.py
   ```

For new deployments:
- The fix will be applied automatically during database initialization

## Testing
After applying the fix, test by:
1. Searching for keywords that exist in your messages
2. Verify that matching words are highlighted in yellow in the search results
3. Check both the content preview and the highlights section
