## Conversation Flow Patterns

### 1. Linear Flow
**Most Common Pattern (99% of conversations)**

Standard request-response pattern where each message has exactly one parent and at most one child.

```
User → Assistant → User → Assistant → ...
```

**Characteristics:**
- Sequential `parent_uuid` chains (using snake_case field naming)
- Single conversation thread
- No branching or alternatives
- Straightforward navigation

**Use Cases:**
- Simple Q&A sessions
- Step-by-step instructions
- Linear problem-solving

### 2. Branching (Alternative Responses)
**Found in 3,075 instances across analyzed data**

Occurs when multiple responses are generated from the same parent message, creating alternative conversation paths within the same session.

```
         ├→ Assistant v1 → User continues...
User →   ├→ Assistant v2 → Different continuation...
         └→ Assistant v3 → Another path...
```

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple messages share same `parent_uuid` (using snake_case field naming)
- Same `session_id` for all branches
- Created through regeneration or alternative approaches
- Maximum observed branching factor: 5

**Use Cases:**
- Regenerating unsatisfactory responses
- Exploring different solution approaches
- A/B testing responses
- Trying different tones or styles

**Data Example:**
```json
// Parent message
{
  "uuid": "parent-123",
  "type": "user",
  "content": "Explain this concept"
}

// Branch 1
{
  "uuid": "branch-1",
  "parent_uuid": "parent-123",
  "type": "assistant",
  "content": "Technical explanation...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-05T10:00:00Z"
}

// Branch 2 (regenerated)
{
  "uuid": "branch-2",
  "parent_uuid": "parent-123",  // Same parent
  "type": "assistant",
  "content": "Simplified explanation...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-05T10:00:30Z"
}
```

### 3. Tool Operations and Sidechains
**Tool operations extracted from assistant messages**

Tool operations in Claude are embedded within assistant messages and extracted during ingest as separate tool_use and tool_result messages marked as sidechains. The frontend automatically treats both messages with `isSidechain: true` AND messages with `type: "tool_use"` or `type: "tool_result"` as sidechains.

```
User → Assistant (initial response)
       └── Assistant (with tool_use content)
           ├── Tool Use (extracted, isSidechain: true)
           │   └── Tool Result (extracted, isSidechain: true)
           └── Assistant (continuation with results)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Tool operations are embedded in assistant message content blocks
- Extracted as separate messages during ingest with correct `parent_uuid` relationships
- Tool Use messages have `parent_uuid` pointing to containing Assistant message
- Tool Result messages have `parent_uuid` pointing to corresponding Tool Use message
- Marked with `isSidechain: true` for UI grouping (but UI also recognizes tool_use/tool_result types)
- Proper parent-child hierarchy: Assistant → Tool Use → Tool Result

**Use Cases:**
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit)
- Code execution (Bash, Python)
- Web operations (Search, Fetch)
- Task management (TodoWrite)

**Important:** See [message-hierarchy-structure.md](./message-hierarchy-structure.md) for complete tool operation handling details.

### 4. Forking (New Session from Existing)
**Capability exists but 0 instances found in analyzed data**

Creates an entirely new conversation session starting from a specific message in another session, allowing independent exploration.

```
Session A:                    Session B (Forked):
User → Assistant → User  →→→  User (continues from fork point)
         ↓                           ↓
    Continues...              Independent continuation...
```

**Characteristics:**
- Creates new `sessionId`
- Independent conversation branch
- Original session unaffected
- Maintains reference to fork origin

**Use Cases:**
- Major directional changes
- "What if" scenarios
- Creating conversation templates
- Experimenting without affecting original

**Theoretical Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "new-session-xyz",    // NEW session
  "uuid": "fork-msg-1",
  "parent_uuid": "original-msg-456",  // From different session
  "forkedFrom": "original-session-abc",
  "type": "user",
  "message": {
    "content": "Let's try a different approach..."
  }
}
```

### 5. Conversation Merging (Proposed Advanced Feature)
**Not currently implemented - Advanced capability**

Ability to combine multiple conversation branches or insights from parallel paths into a single unified conversation flow.

```
Branch A: Solution 1 ─┐
Branch B: Solution 2 ─┼→ Merged: Combined best of all
Branch C: Solution 3 ─┘
```

**Proposed Characteristics:**
- Combines multiple branches
- AI-assisted or manual merge strategies
- Creates new unified branch
- Preserves branch history

**Potential Use Cases:**
- Combining best solutions from multiple attempts
- Consolidating research from different branches
- Creating comprehensive solutions
- Knowledge synthesis

## Implementation Considerations

### For UI Development
1. **Branch Navigation**: UI elements to switch between alternatives
2. **Sidechain Panel**: Group tool operations under their parent assistant message
3. **Tree Visualization**: Handle deeper nesting from tool message hierarchies
4. **Message Indentation**: Visual nesting for tool operations

### For Backend Development
1. **Tool Extraction**: Extract tool_use blocks from assistant messages during ingest
2. **Parent Assignment**: Set correct parent_uuid for extracted tool messages (tool_use → assistant, tool_result → tool_use)
3. **Field Naming**: API returns snake_case fields (parent_uuid, session_id, cost_usd, created_at)
4. **Sidechain Marking**: Automatically mark tool_use/tool_result as isSidechain: true

### For Data Processing
1. **Message Chain Detection**: Identify assistant message chains with tool operations
2. **Tool Pairing**: Ensure tool_use messages have corresponding tool_result with proper parent_uuid chains
3. **Migration**: Update existing messages to correct hierarchy structure with snake_case fields
4. **Validation**: Verify parent_uuid relationships are consistent and tool messages properly nested

**Note:** See [message-hierarchy-structure.md](./message-hierarchy-structure.md) for detailed implementation specifications.

## Conclusion

Claude's conversation system supports multiple patterns:
- **Linear flows** for simple interactions (99% of conversations)
- **Branching** for alternative responses and regeneration
- **Tool operations** embedded in assistant messages, extracted as sidechains
- **Future capabilities** for forking and merging conversations

The key insights are:
1. **Tool Operations**: Embedded within assistant message content blocks in raw data, extracted during ingest with proper parent_uuid hierarchy
2. **Field Naming**: Frontend uses snake_case fields (parent_uuid, session_id) to match API responses
3. **Sidechain Detection**: UI automatically recognizes both `isSidechain: true` messages AND tool_use/tool_result message types
4. **Correct Hierarchy**: Tool Use messages point to containing Assistant, Tool Result messages point to corresponding Tool Use, enabling proper grouping in sidechain panel
